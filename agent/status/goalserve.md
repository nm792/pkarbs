# status: Goalserve trial — capture RUNNING (Part A), 4 sports; 404 claims CORRECTED

Updated: 13 Nov 2026 13:25Z UTC (probe run 13:09-13:19Z; this file's earlier 404 lines
are corrected in place — see "Corrections 13:25Z")

- **Env file:** `/etc/pkarbs/goalserve.env` — mode 600, GOALSERVE_USER + GOALSERVE_KEY (never printed/committed).
- **Egress-IP whitelist: yes** (prior check + IT).
- **Auth:** user+key authenticated — `inplay-tennis.gz?user&key` HTTP 200 (~221 ms).
- **GET TOKEN (`live.goalserve.com/api/v1/auth/gettoken`):** **WORKS — HTTP 200 with JSON
  body `{"apiKey": KEY}`** (181 B, returns a token; `{"user","apiKey"}` also 200).
  The earlier "400 in every field mapping" was the wrong field name: `{"key": KEY}` is the
  only mapping tested that returns 400 ("API key is missing or malformed"). Full forms in
  `agent/status/goalserve-probe.md`.
- **Capture:** RUNNING, tmux `goalserve`, `live/goalserve/capture.py`, log
  `/vol2/goalserve/goalserve_YYYYMMDD.jsonl` (recv_ns, sha1, change first-seen per poll).
  Newest row 13:23:47Z, no errors, 22.1 MB today.
  - Polling (verified OK): **tennis, soccer, baseball, hockey (NHL)**.
- Started 02:38Z 13 Nov; ~1 poll/s, error-safe (429/404 logged and skipped).

## Corrections 13:25Z (13 Nov, probe `goalserve-probe.md`)

- ~~basketball (404), esports Lol/CS2/Dota2 (404/empty) not available~~ — **WRONG.**
  Measured 13:09-13:18Z: `inplay-basket.gz` 200 (133,718 B, 7 events),
  `inplay-esports.gz` 200 (98,339 B, 4 live events incl. cs2/dota; also 200 without
  creds), `inplay-volleyball.gz` 200 (115,908 B, 4 events). The earlier 404s were never
  measured against these URLs — `capture.py` does not request them (its SPORTS dict has
  only tennis/soccer/baseball/hockey).
- `inplay-amfootball.gz` = 200 with an EMPTY `events:{}` (102 B) — empty-now, not 404.
- `inplay-cricket.gz` = 404, expected per the note (no cricket inplay file; not a failure).
- Cricket livescore path `cricket/livescore`: 400 (empty) on livescore.host for every
  variant tried, 404 on inplay./live. hosts — blocked on the exact URL from the vendor
  docs (asked in the inbox reply).
- **Esports capture: NOT started.** New collector = class 4 (charter 5/15: needs 1-h
  measured MB/day trial, writers.conf row, pause hook, box folder, end date). Filed as
  APPROVALS.md item **#13** (exact change + revert) — tmux capture untouched.

Next: bind the PM/CLOB + TheSports recorders for the matching markets (Part A alignment);
esports start releases with APPROVALS #13; cricket livescore on the docs URL.
